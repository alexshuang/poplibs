/**
 * This class supports block-sparse matrix multiplication.
 *
 * The class only saves the sparsity mask, the matrix size, the block size,
 * and the data type, which are used to generate the computation graph.
 *
 * The matrix data is passed in when function \c bsMatMul() or \c bsUpdate()
 * gets called.
 *
 * The purpose of this design is to reuse the instance of this class when only
 * the data of the matrix is changed, and the matrix sparsity does not change.
 *
 * The current implementation is based on Zoltan to generate the hypergraph
 * partition for all tiles. Zoltan usually runs 2 minutes for ~16k non-zero
 * blocks, which is expensive if it runs for every matrix multiplication.
 *
 * The right matrix is always sparse, and the left matrix can be dense or
 * sparse.
